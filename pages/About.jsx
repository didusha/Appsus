            <p>
                This application was developed as a collaborative project by <strong>Avihay Revivo</strong> and <strong>Adi Bar</strong>.
                It consists of two main pages: a <strong>note-taking page</strong>, where users can create, edit, color, and pin notes â€”
                and a <strong>Gmail-inspired page</strong>, designed to simulate basic email functionality.
                Throughout the development process, we focused on creating an intuitive user experience with a clean and responsive design.
                Every component was built with attention to detail, aiming to provide both functionality and a pleasant interface.
